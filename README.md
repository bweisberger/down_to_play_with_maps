# DTP
game meetup app
Fullstack Development of an App - DTP (pseudonym)

App Decsription
This app aims to help people play in-person games/sports/activites with other people on short notice in their 
local geography. BJS developed an app that provides a platform for users to choose to sign up for a variety of 
games 'hosted' by other registered users. Registered users can choose to sign up as a 'player' for up to three 
games at a time or as a 'host' for a game of their creation which other users can sign up to play. 

Data Structure
Users register by providing an email, password, and city/state, and contact info. Users can choose to create a game as
a 'host.' A host provides the required attributes: event name (e.g. Pete's Ping-Pong Pow-Wow, name of game being played 
(e.g. ping-pong), location, date, available player spots, and description which should include and associated costs
to play.  The user is assigned a userID.
Users can view available games on the game index page and choose to sign up to play.
